This archive contains a 10meg bootable hard disk image with FreeDOS 8h1
installed, and a bochsrc.txt configuration file to help you get started.

Please note that in order to start Bochs you also need a ROM BIOS image
and a VGA BIOS image.  These are not included because they quickly go
out of date.  The bochsrc.txt uses an environment variable $BXSHARE to
locate the BIOS files.  So you can either set BXSHARE to point to the
directory that has recent BIOS images, or edit bochsrc to use paths that
are appropriate to your system.
